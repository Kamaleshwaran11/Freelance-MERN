## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Package Manager (e.g., npm or yarn)

## Installation
1.Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kamaleshwaran11/Freelance-MERN.git
cd Freelance-MERN
```
2.Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
```
# Backend
cd server
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../client
npm install
```
## Running the Application
You can start the backend and frontend servers independently, or use concurrently to run them together.

### Step 1: Backend (Node.js)
1.Navigate to the server directory:
```
cd server
```
2.Create a .env file in the server folder with the following variables:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Connection String>
```
3.Run the server:
```
npm start
```
The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000.`
### Step 2: Frontend (React)
1.Navigate to the client directory:
```
cd ../client
```
2.Create a .env file in the client folder with the following variable:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
3.Run the client:
```
npm start
```
The React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000.`
## Running Both with `concurrently`
To run both servers with a single command, install `concurrently` in the root directory:
```
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```
Then, in the root `package.json`, add:
```
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"",
  "server": "cd server && npm start",
  "client": "cd client && npm start"
}
```
Now, you can start both servers with:
```
npm start
```
